# Artificial Intelligence Applications Projects

## Comprehensive Application

### Overview

This project involves classifying photos and moving them to corresponding folders. For photos categorized as "people", it performs face detection to determine whether the individuals in the photos are wearing masks. The results are then marked directly on the images.

### Process

1. Classify photos.
2. Move photos to respective folders.
3. Detect faces in photos categorized as "people".
4. Identify whether the individuals are wearing masks.
5. Mark the findings on the images.

## Result

Note: As this project was completed on a course website, the file paths provided in the code will not function in a local environment. The code is included here for display purposes only.
